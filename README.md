# alphameltsData

To use these scripts, all you have to do is, download the zip of the scripts using the option available.
Once Downloaded, extract these files.
In your "links" folder of alphaMelts Software, create a folder named "Scripts"
Copy all the extracted files (not folder, the files), to this "Scripts" folder.

All you have to do next is, after running the alphaMelts software, and closing the software by clicking the 'X' mark at the top,
run the "beautifyData.bat" file from the Scripts folder, so that output files are created.

After that, the data can further be used to create beautidul plots, either using Python or some other Third Party Software
